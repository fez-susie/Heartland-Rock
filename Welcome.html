                Heartland Rock - the Game
            </h1>

                Hello!
                My name is Aidan de Sousa and I am taking part in Stage 1: Design, Technologies, and Engineering as part of my SACE Education in 2022.
                For my major project in this subject, I am to construct a video game with essential free choice as to whatever elements I choose to include.
                For this, I have constructed a game called Heartland Rock which looks at themes from the 1970s.
                The game is a platformer in which you explore the world of a person living in the 70s.<br><br>
                What Iâ€™d like you to do is to play the game.
                Below is a link to a form which has options for you to provide feedback.
                Any feedback is welcome and will be acted upon to help construct a better game in the coming future. 
                So, please enjoy and any feedback is helpful.<br>
            </p>
