                Hello!
                <br>
                <br>
                My name is Aidan de Sousa, and I am taking part in the SACE Course Stage 1: Design, Technology and Engineering specifically around coding for games.
                The course has three assessment types: an issues exploration, a skills development, and a main project.
                <br>
                <br>
                This website is for feedback on my main project, the game I have created.
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h2>

            <p>
                For my main project, I have developed a game using GameMaker Studio 2 by YoYo Games.
                My game is called Heartland Rock as it contains music from that specific genre including the works of Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and Creedence Clearwater Revival.
                The platformer structure takes inspiration from games including PlayDead’s Inside and Nintendo’s original Super Mario Bros.
                <br>
                <br>
                The main project has included my work from the other two assessments.
                My skills development investigated array usage in gaming and how certain programs can utilise these matrices to store and retrieve data.
                My issues exploration was around gender equality in video gaming and so the character I created aimed to fit with the solutions I identified in my exploration.
                I’ve attached both of these two assessments in the website.
